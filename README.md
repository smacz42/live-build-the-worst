# Debian Live-Build

This live-build uses the debian live-build process detailed [here](https://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/live-manual/unstable/manual/html/live-manual.en.html)

This seeks to incorporate several paradigms into the LiveUSB

* Kali Tools (top 10 only ATM)
* BunsenLabs Themeing
* Git/Zsh/Vim/Tmux/Ranger (For cli workflow)
* Games (Zdoom & supertuxkart)
* Based on Debian Testing
* AirVPN client (latest)

Instructions for build system to come - Debian latest netinstall && upgrade to testing _should_ be sufficient.
