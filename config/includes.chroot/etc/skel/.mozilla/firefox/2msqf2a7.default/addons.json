It has similar key bindings and you could call it a modal web browser, as key bindings differ according to which mode you are in. For example, it has a special Hint mode, where you can follow links easily with the keyboard only. Also most functionality is available as commands, typing :back will go back within the current page history, just like hitting the back button in the toolbar.\n\nBut Vimperator is more than just a simple command interface to Firefox — it is a complete development environment as well. If you are a web developer, you can enjoy an interactive JavaScript shell — even with completion support. Or if you want to extend Vimperator, you can easily do that by just dropping a JavaScript file in its plugin directory.\n\nVimperator was initially written by Martin Stubenschrott but has found many other contributors in the meanwhile.\n\nIf there are any issues, please check out our issue tracker https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/issues and add the issue if it isn't already recorded.\n\n=== Features ===\n\n* Vim-like keybindings (h, j, k, l, gg, G, 0, $, ZZ, , etc.)\n* Ex commands (:quit, :open www.foo.com, ...)\n* Tab completion available for all commands with support for 'longest' matching when set in 'wildmode'\n* Extensions! Yes, you can extend Vimperator's functionality with scripts just like you can extend Firefox with extensions.\n* Explore JavaScript objects with :echo window and even context-sensitive tab completion.\n* Hit-a-hint like navigation of links (start with f to follow a link)\n* Advanced completion of bookmark and history URLs (searching also in title, not only URL)\n* Vim-like statusline with a wget-like progress bar\n* Minimal GUI (easily hide useless menubar and toolbar with :set guioptions=)\n* Ability to :source JavaScript files, and to use a ~/.vimperatorrc file\n* Easy quick searches (:open foo will search for \"foo\" in google, :open ebay terminator will search for \"terminator\" on ebay) with support for Firefox keyword bookmarks and search engines\n* Count supported for many commands (3 will go back 3 pages)\n* Beep on errors\n* Marks support (ma to set mark 'a' on a webpage, 'a to go there)\n* QuickMarks support (quickly go to previously marked web pages with go{a-zA-Z0-9})\n* :map and :command support (and feedkeys() for script writers)\n* :time support for profiling\n* Move the text cursor and select text with vim keys and a visual mode.\n* External editor support\n* Macros to replay key strokes\n* AutoCommands to execute action on certain events\n* A comprehensive :help, explaining all commands, mappings and options.\n* Much more...","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Hints allow to follow links with the keyboard"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Vimperator's completion system"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Exploring the DOM of the web page"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.vimperator.org/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/514842/vimperator-3.15.0-fx.xpi?src=api","size":465474,"contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":"$10.00","developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":208,"totalDownloads":821490,"weeklyDownloads":1713,"dailyUsers":31967,"updateDate":1476482689000,"supportURL":"http://www.vimperator.org"},{"id":"jid1-xUfzOsOFlzSOXg@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/387/387429-32.png?modified=1481113219","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/387/387429-64.png?modified=1481113219"},"name":"Reddit Enhancement Suite","type":"extension","version":"5.2.0","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"honestbleeps","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/honestbleeps/?src=api"},"description":"NOTE: Reddit Enhancement Suite is developed independently, and is not officially endorsed by or affiliated with reddit.\n\nRES is a suite of tools to enhance your reddit browsing experience.","fullDescription":"NOTE: Reddit Enhancement Suite is developed independently, and is not officially endorsed by or affiliated with reddit.\n\nReddit Enhancement Suite is a suite of tools to enhance your Reddit browsing experience.

Gets rid of a site's cookies and LocalStorage as soon as you close its tabs. Protects against trackers and zombie-cookies. Trustworthy services can be whitelisted.","fullDescription":"Self-Destructing Cookies is not just a cookie manager, it's a new cookie policy. Do you think that cookies should need a reason to persist in your cookie jar, i.e. you currently interacting with the site that set them? Would you prefer your cookie jar to be empty in its steady state, except for a few sites that you care about? Are you worried about unconventional tracking methods? Then give this add-on a try.\n\nSelf-Destructing Cookies automatically removes cookies when they are no longer used by open browser tabs. With the cookies, lingering sessions, as well as information used to spy on you, will be expunged. Websites will only be permitted to identify you while you actually use them and can not stalk you across the entire web. This is the closest you will get to cookieless browsing without breaking every second site or tedious micromanaging.\n\nTracking cookies will be detected and removed immediately. They are identified purely by their behaviour - no need for a blacklist that needs to be kept up to-date. Self-Destructing Cookies also has LocalStorage support and will treat it just like your cookie jar. Defend yourself against ETag tracking and other cache-based black-hat techniques by configuring Self-Destructing Cookies to automatically clean your cache every time you are not actively using the browser. For the first time ever, this provides a realistic chance of beating zombie-/evercookies without sacrificing usability. See the zombie-cookie FAQ entry for details. Self-Destructing Cookies can also help protect against CSRF attacks by ending your sessions as soon as possible.\n\nThis add-on complements blacklist-based solutions such as Adblock and Ghostery very well. You can whitelist sites whose cookies and LocalStorage you would like to keep without an active tab in the Firefox cookie exception list, which can also be conveniently accessed from the add-on's preferences, or an icon in the Add-on Bar.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions and Common Problems\n\nQ: What about Zombie-/Evercookies?\nA: SDC gives you a fighting chance against such black-hat techniques. To beat the Evercookie, enable automatic cache cleaning in SDC's preferences. If you are on a decent, unmetered connection, there is no harm in setting the idle timeout to a low value, such as 3 minutes. You should also set all of your plugins to click-to-play, install BetterPrivacy and configure it to automatically clean unused LSOs. Please note that SDC will not clean LocalStorage scopes of sites served via HTTPS if you are running a Firefox version prior to 23. This is due to a limitation in Firefox's DOM storage API in those versions.\n\nQ: Can I disable the notification pop-ups?\nA: Yes. Open the add-on manager. You can reach it via Firefox's menu, or by just entering \"about:addons\" without the quotes in your location bar. Locate Self-Destructing Cookies in your list of extensions, click the Preferences button and remove the checkmark next to \"Notifications\".\n\nQ: Since I installed the add-on, the removal notifications just won't stop. I'm not even using the browser at the moment.\nA: You are probably using another add-on that re-adds certain cookies when they are removed, e.g. Beef Taco or TrackerBlock which both try to persist opt-out cookies. SDC and the other add-on are having an infinite debate about whether to keep those cookies. Choose a side and disable the other one.\n\nQ: The entire whitelist is empty each time I restart Firefox.\nA: You probably have Firefox's privacy preferences set to \"Clear History when Firefox closes\" and included \"Site Preferences\" in the corresponding menu. SDC's whitelist is stored as site preferences.\n\nQ: A specific site forgets my login, even though it is on my whitelist.\nIf you added the entries manually, make sure you whitelisted the base domains of your sites (e.g. \"example.com\", not \"www.example.com\"). That's where cookies are generally stored.\nIf you added it via the icon, the login might depend on external domains. Keep an eye on the removal notifications the next time you log *in* there. The domains that appear in the following seconds are probably the ones you want on your whitelist as well.\n\nQ: The add-on does not work in private browsing mode.\nA: Some parts of Firefox are off-limits for add-ons while you are in private browsing mode. This includes the cookie jar for example. There's nothing I can do about this, sorry.\n\nQ: I have configured Firefox to block all cookies by default. Can I still use SDC?\nA: There is an unsupported hidden setting that changes the behaviour of the \"yellow\" whitelist level from allow-for-session to allow-while-open. To enable it, create a boolean key in your about:config named \"extensions.jid0-9XfBwUWnvPx4wWsfBWMCm4Jj69E@jetpack.defaultBlock\" (without the quotes), set it to true and restart your browser. You can now use the \"yellow\" setting for sites whose cookies you would like to accept, but still have them self-destruct. I provide this on a \"should work\" basis, meaning that I depend on bug reports from you and don't do in-depth testing of this mode myself.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/98/98894.png?src=api&modified=1367914213","width":"650","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/98/98894.png?src=api&modified=1367914213","thumbnailWidth":"186","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Gets rid of a site's cookies as soon as you close its last tab."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/98/98896.png?src=api&modified=1367914213","width":"587","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/98/98896.png?src=api&modified=1367914213","thumbnailWidth":"168","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Detects and removes trackers without the need for a blacklist - purely by their behaviour.

This new cookie generation offers unlimited user tracking to industry and market research. Concerning privacy Flash-cookies are most critical.\nThis add-on was made to make users aware of those hidden, never expiring objects and to offer an easier way to view and to manage them - since browsers are unable to do that for you.\n\nFlash-cookies (Local Shared Objects, LSO) are pieces of information placed on your computer by a Flash plug-in. Those Super-Cookies are placed in central system folders. They are frequently used like standard browser cookies. Although their threat potential is much higher as of conventional cookies, only few users began to take notice of them.\n\nBetterPrivacy allows to list and manage Flash-cookies, e.g. to remove those objects automatically on browser start, browser exit or by a configurable timer function while certain desired Flash cookies can be excluded from automatic deletion. So this extension becomes sort of \"install and forget add-on\". Usually automatic deletion is safe (no negative impact on your browsing), especially if the deletion timer is activated. The timer can delay automatic deletion for new or modified Flash-cookies which might be in use. It also allows to delete those objects immediately if desired. Users who wish to to manage all Flash-cookies manually can disable the automatic functions or exclude certain Flash-cookies from automatic deletion.\n\nSome Flash-cookie (LSO) properties in short...\n- they are never expiring - staying on your computer for an unlimited time.\n- by default they offer a storage of 100 KB (compare: Usual cookies 4 KB).\n- browsers are not fully aware of LSO's, They often cannot be displayed or managed by browsers.\n- via Flash they can access and store highly specific personal and technical information (system, user name, files,...).\n- ability to send the stored information to the appropriate server, without user's permission.\n- Flash applications do not need to be visible\n- there is no easy way to tell which Flash-cookie sites are tracking you.\n- shared folders allow cross-browser tracking, LSO's work in every flash-enabled application\n- the Flash company doesn't provide a user-friendly way to manage LSO's, In fact it's incredible cumbersome.\n- many domains and tracking companies make extensive use of Flash-cookies.\nThis kind of cookies is not harmless.\n\n\n\n------------------------- IMPORTANT -------------------------\nIF YOU PERMIT DELETION OF LSO's,\nTHEN COOKIE-STORED INFORMATION LIKE\nGAME SETTINGS OR LOGIN DATA (YAHOO SEAL)\nMIGHT BE LOST! MAKE SURE THAT YOU EXCLUDED\nIMPORTANT COOKIES FROM DELETION (SEE FAQ)\n\n\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ):\nPlease scroll to the bottom of the page.\n\nRecommended comprehensive Flash-cookie article (topic: UC Berkeley research report)\nhttp://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/08/you-deleted-your-cookies-think-again/\n\nWikipedia LSO information:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Shared_Object\n\nSee what Google finds:\nhttp://google.com/search?q=flash-cookie+super-cookie\n\nOther privacy add-ons strongly recommended:\n1.

Some users consider the default cookie as important since it keeps Flash-Player update settings as well as some camera or microphone settings. The default cookie also keeps a complete list of all visited LSO pages. However, the stored data associated with those visited pages will be deleted by BetterPrivacy though.\nAs long as the default cookie is kept, Flash-Player's settings-manager still shows a complete list of all visited pages, even if BetterPrivacy deleted all data storing objects. Go to BetterPrivacy's options and check 'Also delete Flash-Player default cookie' in order to remove the list of visited pages as well as the Flash-Player settings.\n\n----------\n\nQ: Error-message: Flash application data folder not found!\n\nA: As noted at the beginning, if you do not have a FLASH-plug-in installed, then you do NOT need BetterPrivacy! Only a Flash-plug-in can place LSO's on your disk. Otherwise make sure that your browser-Flash-plug-in is correctly installed and that it works.\n\n----------\n\nQ: Error-message: BetterPrivacy is searching for your Flash-cookie directory. The search takes longer than expected.\n\nA: In Firefox open BetterPrivacy (Menu->Tools->BetterPrivacy) and enter the correct path of your Flash data directory. Depending on your operating system this should be one of the following paths:\nWindows: %APPDATA%\\Macromedia\\Flash Player\\\nMacintosh: ~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash Player/\nLinux/Unix: ~/.macromedia/Flash_Player/\n\n----------\n\nQ: Flash has a built-in panel to define storage settings, why should I use an add-on?\nQ: What about the 'Global Privacy Settings panel' located on a fairly hidden company page?\n\nA: The usual Flash control panel only provides an option to set a storage limit on a per site basis. Thus you would need to define a new limit for every single Flash-site you visit. If you look at many different sites a day you easily end up in wasting your time by defining all those limits. Moreover there exist functional Flash embeds that are not visible - so you would not be aware that you missed to define a limit.\nA: You can use it to globally deny storage of web site data - but as storage is disabled it might happen that a LSO powered site denies it's service too. Of course, with global settings you cannot make exceptions. Besides the global LSO there will be stored additional settings LSO's for every Flash site (so some tracking still remains possible). Also be aware that the global settings LSO does not get deleted. Note that the company could have made this global panel available from the right click menu but they didn't. All in all you see that the process for managing permissions is practically unusable.\n\n----------\n\nQ: How to find out how many cookies currently are stored on my computer?\n\nA: Go to BetterPrivacy's options (Firefox tools menu), LSO-manager tab. All currently stored LSOs, if any, are listed there. Note that some sites store their cookies instantly when loading, others not before they are closing.\n\n----------\n\nQ: What might happen if I give permission to delete (some of) my LSOs?\n\nA: It is pretty much the same thing as with usual cookies. In most cases nothing happens. However, to gain all conveniences some services might require you to be tracked. For example they could store some data (e.g. Flash game settings) together with the tracking data itself. They bundle some interesting feature along with tracking data to get you to keep the awful cookie. Read next topic on how to exclude special cookies from deletion.\n\n----------\n\nQ: How to exclude certain LSOs from automatic deletion?\n\nA: Go to BetterPrivacy's options (Firefox tools menu), LSO-manager tab, select the site/cookie folder you want to exclude and press 'Prevent automatic LSO deletion'. Note that you allow tracking with every excluded LSO. Important: Protection means those LSO's are excluded from BetterPrivacy's deletion but the owner web site still can delete them as well as any other programs you might have running!\n\n----------\n\nQ: How to select more than one LSO at a time?\n\nA: With BetterPrivacy you do not need to select multiple LSO's, BetterPrivacy provides a more user-friendly kind of selection: Just highlight those (usually few) LSO's you wish to exclude from deletion and press the \"Prevent automatic LSO deletion\" - button for each excluded LSO. Finally press the \"Remove all\" - button. You will be asked if you wish to delete every LSO or only those which are not excluded.\n\n----------\n\nQ: What means <settings LSO>, <default LSO>, <local LSO>\n\nA: A settings-LSO does not store any data defined by websites, but about those sites: It can store information which is defined by you - the computer user. Therefore each settings-LSO needs to store the website-URL in order to identify the appropriate pages. The user-defined information can be used to determine how the Flash-player should behave on a certain site (e.g. special site volume or camera settings or rules that describe how to handle LSO's on the site). Thus it usually is not necessary to delete this kind of LSO. The user-defined data is not accessible by websites. However, if someone has physical access to your computer (e.g. multi-user system) other locally present users could see which Flash-sites have been visited in the past. The default-LSO is a special settings-LSO storing global (default) settings-data, as well as Flash-player-update settings. This LSO also keeps a complete list of all visited Flash-sites. In BetterPrivacy it is excluded from automatic deletion by default, but you can change this behavior in the BetterPrivacy options. A local-LSO is not stored by a website but by Flash-software installed on your computer.\n\n----------\n\nQ: Does BetterPrivacy block any sites or alter any settings of my Firefox installation?\n\nA: No! BetterPrivacy never modifies web pages! The add-on does not even know that web sites exist. It just looks in the cookie folder on your hard disk at the end of a Firefox session. For sure, if you confirmed to delete some LSOs it might happen that some previously LSO-stored data, e.g. Flash game settings, are lost: It is as like as with usual cookies! To prevent such data loss, see above (How to exclude...). BetterPrivacy also stores some own preferences using a unique name space, just as every add-on does.\n\n----------\n\nQ: Does every Flash application/video place a cookie on my hard disk?\n\nA: No! There are many Flash applications which store nothing on your computer. Though BetterPrivacy will not affect them in any way.\n\n----------\n\nQ: Is Firefox's 'Delete Private Data' function capable of deleting LSOs?\n\nA: Yes, but only since Firefox version 5 and higher. To delete LSOs, Firefox currently uses the the settings for usual cookies. However, there still is no option to exclude certain LSOs from deletion or to see which LSOs have been stored.\n\n----------\n\nQ: Why is it not possible to manage exclusions on a 'per site' basis like e.g. Adblock does?\n\nA: Though it is installed as a plug-in, Flash still runs as an external application on your computer. So Flash does not permit to be intercepted on cookie storage and moreover it's cookies can be accessed only indirectly. Thus an add-on -like BetterPrivacy- can only get limited information, derived from cookies and their folder structure.\n\n----------\n\nQ: Are there other ways to delete those LSOs, not using BetterPrivacy?\n\nA: Yes, for sure! For example...\n- You could write a short script to do this for you, eg. batch or vbs.\n- Objection is an alternate Firefox extension capable of acting like BetterPrivacy.\n- Flash itself provides an option to set a storage limit on a per site basis, but you would need to define a new limit for every Flash-site you visit.\n-You might also use an external 3rd party application which you would need to install on your computer.\n- Finally you can delete the LSO's manually by using a simple file manager. See Wikipedia article, which is mentioned above, for details.\n- Add-ons like 'FlashBlock' do not block Flash-cookies because they only prevent Flash from being displayed but Flash is still loaded. Also FlashBlock and similar add-ons can be defeated by simple HTML code\n\n----------\n\nQ: Why does BetterPrivacy not delete the Asset-cache or Flash folder xyz?\n\nA: BetterPrivacy only deletes privacy related data, that means data that helps to identify the user or computer. Fore sure, data of that kind must also be accessible by web sites. It is a common misunderstanding: The Asset-cache does not store such data.\n\n----------\n\nQ: How to know what LSOs were generated during the session?\n\nA: Open the LSO manager and click the modified column. Then all LSO's are sorted by creation date. You should see the most recent on top.\n\n----------\n\nQ: BetterPrivacy fails to delete LSO's! Is this a bug?\n\nA: No, probably not, there can be several reasons for this behavior, such as:\n\n    In BetterPrivacy the Adobe settings.sol LSO is excluded from deletion by default. If you wish to change that behavior, open BetterPrivacy options and enable the setting 'Always delete the Flash-player default cookie'. Though the default LSO stores a list of visited Flash-Pages, it is not necessarily considered as a privacy threat. Web-pages generally have no access to that list. Sites can only see information of LSO's created and stored by same site.\n    Details: LSO's with name settings.sol are not created by web-pages but by the Flash application running on your local computer. The Flash application needs the settings.sol file to determine the valid origin of LSO's created and stored by web-pages. Settings.sol files also store the volume settings you have choosen for a particular web-page. Information other than that is not stored. Thus settings.sol files are no threat and in BetterPrivacy are excluded from deletion by default. However, users who share their computer with other persons, and both are using the same computer profile could be concerned about privacy. Using the same computer and account it is possible to visit the Adobe online Flash manager and to see what Flash-sites the other user recently visited. For this special situation of multi-user computer profiles it is possible to delete the settings.sol files too.\n    Deleting a LSO does not mean that a Flash application cannot recreate the LSO at any time later or even immediately! Any loaded Flash application is able to recreate LSO's at any time, regardless of an existing Internet connection, regardless of the Flash application's visibility or cache status. Even while closing a web-page tab a LSO can be created. BetterPrivacy does not block LSO's (that's technically not possible in Firefox since plug-ins are independent applications installed directly on your OS) but this add-on uses the much smarter solution of delayed deletion. This allows LSO-dependent Flash applications to work properly without denying their service while any usable tracking capabilities still are prevented.\n    Make sure that you did not accidentally exclude LSO's from deletion.\n    If you quit Firefox while still having web-pages in tabs opened and one one of those pages is capable to store LSOs, it can happen that LSO's will not be deleted (even if BetterPrivacy is configured to delete all LSO's when quitting Firefox). This is caused by a technical limitation of the Mozilla browsers: When you quit e.g. Firefox, BetterPrivacy uses the latest possible chance to delete stored LSO's. However, at that time the web-pages can still be loaded and active, since Firefox sometimes first terminates it's add-ons before it closes all web-pages. Thus a web-page has a chance to store a LSO after add-ons already have been unloaded by Firefox. In other words, BetterPrivacy cannot detect LSO's that are stored at a later time as the beginning of Firefox shutdown. This Firefox behavior has been seen for FF version 3.x and certain browser configurations, however the bug might be fixed in future versions.\n    If this is a problem for you, choose one of the following solutions: Either activate the BetterPrivacy setting to delete LSO's at Firefox startup, or make sure that all web-pages (at least Flash-pages) have been closed before quitting Firefox or file a Firefox bug (e.g. add-ons terminated earlier than plug-ins and web-pages) at bugzilla.mozilla.org.\n\n\n----------\n\nQ: BetterPrivacy deletes LSO's though I protected them! Is this a bug?\n\nA: No, probably not, because even if LSO's have been excluded from automatic deletion in BetterPrivacy, they still can be deleted (this cannot be avoided by an add-on) by any other means at any time for any reason, such as:\n\n    deletion by the Firefox 'Clear Recent History' menu function -or- deletion when quitting Firefox (if the Firefox option 'Clear history when Firefox closes' is activated). Firefox versions 5.0 and higher now are natively capable to remove LSOs. However this built-in native functionality still does not allow to exclude certain LSOs from deletion.

It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n***\n\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @ Github:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors\n\nContributors @ Crowdin:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157572.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157572.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Default mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157576.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157576.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The dashboard: stock filter lists"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157592.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157592.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Dynamic filtering allows default-deny mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/159/159634.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/159/159634.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The dashboard: settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158734.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158734.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Unified logger"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/545517/ublock_origin-1.10.0-an+fx+sm+tb.xpi?src=api","size":1548371,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":766,"totalDownloads":12568523,"weeklyDownloads":510014,"dailyUsers":2509996,"updateDate":1480432873000,"supportURL":"https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/support-ublock-origin/6746"},{"id":"html5-video-everywhere@lejenome.me","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addon-icons/video-32.png","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addon-icons/video-64.png"},"name":"HTML5 Video Everywhere!","type":"extension","version":"0.3.4","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"lejenome","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/lejenome/?src=api"},"description":"Replace video player with Firefox native video player","fullDescription":"Some Streaming sites video players sucks.

You can visually group related tabs, switch between groups, and quickly search through all of your tabs to switch to a specific one.","fullDescription":"Contact Info: For reporting problems and bugs, or if you have comments or suggestions, please either send me an email (quicksaver@gmail.com) or go to https://github.com/Quicksaver/Tab-Groups/issues and create an issue, this is so I have a way to communicate with you if I need to.\n\nTab Groups, formerly known as Panorama or TabView, allows you to manage and organize a large number of open tabs.\n\nGroups are incredibly easy to use! When you first install the add-on, the Tab Groups button will appear next to your tabs, but you can move it anywhere you want in the window. Use it to open a quick access panel to quickly switch between your groups or even to switch to a specific tab.\n\nEnter groups management view through that panel and drag tabs across groups or out of their current group to create a new one. When you're done, just click on a tab to leave groups view and go to the chosen tab; only the tabs in the chosen group will be visible. It's that simple.\n\nYou can name groups, resize them and rearrange them visually however you like. Create groups for research, movies, work, fun and all the other various tasks you perform on your browser. You'll organize all those dozens of tabs you have open in no time!\n\nOr even keep all your tabs in a single group, and use the add-on to swiftly find and switch to any tab you want, without having to lose time looking for it in the middle of all your other tabs at the top.\n\nYou can also customize a series of keyboard shortcuts in the add-on's preferences, to quickly enter and leave groups view, open the quick access panel, or switch to other groups using just your keyboard.\n\nBackup and Restore your tabs and groups any time you want! Everything crashes once in a while, but now you can be sure you never lose your tabs again when that happens.\n- Manually backup your groups information at any time to a file anywhere on your disk for safe-keeping. Later, you can restore whole groups from there, or even just a single tab if that's all you want.\n- You can also restore groups and tabs from several automated backups created by Firefox and Tab Groups:\n-- Current Session Recovery: Firefox keeps your current session's information here, to be used in case of crashes. You probably won't be using it much, since whatever groups and tabs you close will be removed from this file as well.\n-- Session Recovery Backup: holds much of the same information as the file above, also used for crash-protection. But it's usually saved with a little delay, so it could be useful in a few cases.\n-- Previous Session: ever restart Firefox to see only your homepage, and all your other tabs gone? Or maybe just forgot to bookmark an important tab from yesterday? More often than not, you can get it all back here.\n-- Firefox Upgrade Backup: every time Firefox upgrades, it holds onto a backup of your session at that point for a while, just in case the upgrade fails and corrupts the session. These should help if all you need is to get your tabs back from before the upgrade.\n-- Tab Groups Update Backup: similar to the above, but for backups created when this add-on updates instead.\n-- Groups Migration Backup: this is a backup of your session made when Firefox first updated to 45. If you've installed Firefox only after, or if you installed this add-on before that happened, then you likely will never see (or need) this.\n-- Groups Manual Backup: if you keep the default file name and save location when backing up your groups, you can also access them from the quick access menu when restoring.\n-- Session Manager Backup: these are session files kept by Session Manager, which is fully compatible with Tab Groups.\n-- Tab Mix Plus Backup: similar to the above, these are session files kept by Tab Mix Plus, which is also fully compatible with Tab Groups.\n\nOther features:\n- There are several different layouts available, as well as many display options; set them to your taste so that your groups always work to your advantage.\n- Start typing anywhere in groups view to search for a specific tab.\n- Use catch rules to automatically move tabs to specific groups by means of regular expressions.\n- Integrates with Tab Mix Plus's options to style unloaded and unread tabs.\n\nNotice: this add-on is based on the Firefox feature of the same name that was removed in Firefox 45. Initially, it was barely more than a copy of that same code that existed in Firefox itself. Since then, almost all of it has been rewritten, not only to improve performance and stability, but also to implement several new features. Despite this, the concept of groups at the core of the add-on remains the same, but hopefully even more awesome than ever.\n\nHidden preferences: I suggest you don't change either of these, so that the add-on adjusts automatically to your environment.\nextensions.tabgroups.forceBrightText - Define which theme to load in groups view. \"0\" is the default value, the add-on will choose based on your current Firefox and system themes; \"1\" will always load the light theme, and \"2\" will always load the dark theme.\nextensions.tabgroups.overrideViewportRatio - Set the aspect ratio for the tab thumbnails. Keep empty to let the add-on adapt to your screen size; any integer or fraction in the form \"width/height\" will be used as a constant aspect ratio for tab thumbnails.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/174/174740.png?src=api&modified=1479904704","width":"646","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/174/174740.png?src=api&modified=1479904704","thumbnailWidth":"185","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"When first installed, the toolbar button is placed next to the tabs.
